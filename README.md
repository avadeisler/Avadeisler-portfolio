# Avadeisler-portfolio
This is my professional coding online portfolio

In this challenge, we were instructed to create a portfolio webiste that will give potential employers
some info about us as well as links to our work and our contact info.
I only have one live work link since my work is limited but made placeholders for future work.
I did get to show off some advanced css skills though!

# Criteria

Here is the criteria for the assignment:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

I had quite a lot of trouble with getting certain links to work and also with some layout challenges.

Here are some screenshots of the page completed as it is now. I am including a screenshot of what it looks like when it is scaled down for phones or other small screens.
